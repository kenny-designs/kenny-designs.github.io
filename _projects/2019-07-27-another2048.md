# What Is 2048?
[2048](https://2048game.com/) is a classic web game in which the goal is to slide the numbered tiles around and combine them until you reach the number 2048. If you manage to get there, you win! If you run out of space to slide the tiles, you lose.

## Another2048 
Another2048 takes the original game and gives it a huge graphical overhaul with the Unreal Engine 4. To do this, I recreated the game with my own C++ code and assets from the Unreal Marketplace to increase the visual appeal.
