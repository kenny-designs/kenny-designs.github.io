# What Is Sworcery?
Sworcery was one of my very first games that I've made (outside of a myriad of command line games). It's one I'm rather fond of and wanted to share on my site.

The game was made with Python and the library [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news). It is a simple platformer in which the player controls an unnamed main character to traverse a pixelated world (one in which I did all of the art and animation myself).
