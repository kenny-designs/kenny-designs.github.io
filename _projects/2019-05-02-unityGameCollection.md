# What Is Unity Games Collection?
As the title denotes, this is a collection of various Unity games I've made. These
were all created with the help of the Udemy tutorial series
[Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/)
and [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/).
As such, I didn't want to make dedicated project pages to each game but I'd still
like to show off what I managed to create! I put a lot of effort into these games
and I hope you enjoy trying them out!

# Argon Assault
[GitHub](https://github.com/kenny-designs/ArgonAssault) and [Live Game](https://kenny-designs.github.io/ArgonAssault/WebGL/index.html)

Argon Assault is a [Starfox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fox) styled game
in which the player flies a spaceship and attempts to get a highscore by destroying
as many enemy ships as possible.

## What I Learned
With this project, I learned how to utilize Unity's timeline system to move the player
and enemies at key moments, sculpt and paint terrain, and program ship movement and
projectiles.

# Boost
[GitHub](https://github.com/kenny-designs/ProjectBoost) and [Live Game](https://kenny-designs.github.io/ProjectBoost/WebGL/index.html)

Boost is a game in which the player must guide their rocket to the end of the
level without crashing into anything. If they do, then they must try again from
the start.

## What I Learned
In this project I learned how to set up minimalistic levels, program rocket movement,
and implement collision.

# Tilevania
[GitHub](https://github.com/kenny-designs/TileVania) and [Live Game](https://kenny-designs.github.io/TileVania/WebGL/index.html)

Tilevania is a platformer in the traditional Mario sense where they must travel
to the end of the stage whilst collecting coins for points and avoiding enemies
and traps.

## What I Learned
Throughout this project, I learned to program basic platformer controls and
features including lives, score, and levels. I also learned to implement a level
editor that allows for painting tiles to the screen to make new levels and even
has tiles change depending on what was placed around them.

# Terminal Hacker

[GitHub](https://github.com/kenny-designs/TerminalHacker) and [Live Game](https://kenny-designs.github.io/TerminalHacker/WebGL/)

Terminal Hacker is a simple game in which you are trying to hack into various servers.
You choose where you want to hack into and are given some scrambled letters. Guess
the right word formed by those letters and you're in!

## What I Learned
I learned how to work with text, take user input, and process that input for the
game.
