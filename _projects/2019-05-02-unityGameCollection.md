# What Is Unity Games Collection?
As the title denotes, this is a collection of various Unity games I've made. These
were all created with the help of the Udemy tutorial series
[Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/)
and [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/).
As such, I didn't want to make dedicated project pages to each game but I'd still
like to show off what I managed to create! I put a lot of effort into these games
and I hope you enjoy trying them out!

# Argon Assault
[GitHub](https://github.com/kenny-designs/ArgonAssault) and [Live Game](https://kenny-designs.github.io/ArgonAssault/WebGL/index.html)

Argon Assault is a [Starfox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fox) styled game
in which the player flies a spaceship and attempts to get a highscore by destroying
as many enemy ships as possible.

## What I Learned
With this project, I learned how to utilize Unity's timeline system to move the player
and enemies at key moments, sculpt and paint terrain, and program ship movement and
projectiles.
