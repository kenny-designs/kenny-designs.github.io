*Hey I'm Alexander :3*

## Introductions
If you wanna know more about my skills, scroll on down to the next section! There's
a lot to read! Anyways, allow me to introduce myself.

I am a programmer and a bit of an artist as well (the header image I made myself in Blender!)
I started programming in my early teens because I had a huge interest in making
games. I didn't really have anyone to show me the ropes so I took it upon myself
to grab whatever books I could to learn to program.

From there, I would dabble with programming and even spent some time pursuing 3D
art. I would go on to make my own little game engine with DirectX and found the
programming to be so much fun that I'd like to make it into my career!

Now, I'm finishing up my BS in Computer Science at Brooklyn College and am excited
to begin working as a programmer!

## Programming
First and foremost, I am a programmer! Ever since I was a young teen, I've been
messing with code. In the many years since, I've worked with tons of languages
to create all sorts of projects.

### Languages
- C++
- C#
- JavaScript
- Java
- Python
- GLSL
- PHP

I'm also experienced in SQL albeit I wouldn't quite say that's a programming
language in itself! Same goes for HTML and CSS.

## Technologies & Software
In addition to knowing how to use various languages, I'm also experienced in
various frameworks, libraries, software, etc.

### Game Engines
- Unreal Engine 4
- Unity
- Phaser
- RenPy

### Graphics Related
- OpenGL
- DirectX
- Qt
- GLFW

### Web Related
- Node.js
- Express
- MySQL
- Java Servlets and JSP (Java Server Pages)
- Bootstrap
- React
- npm
- Jekyll (which this site was made from!)

### Software
- Linux (❤️ Debian)
- Vim
- Git
- Blender
- Photoshop
- Krita
- Gimp

## College
I'm currently a senior attending Brooklyn College in NYC. I'm studying Computer
Science with an expected graduation date of June 2021.

I have a **3.9/4.0 GPA**.

I am a member of the **Honor Society for the Computing and Information Disciplines**.

I've taken the following classes related to programming:

### Classes Finished
- Modern Programming Techniques
- Robotics
- Data Structures
- Web Applications
- Multivariable Calculus
- Computer Architecture

### Classes In Progress

- Algorithms

## Experience
I've also had some intern experience!

I worked as a programmer with the **NYU Music Experience Design Lab** from June
to September in 2017.

### Front-End Developer
- Main developer for rhythm game based web application *Lyric Blaster*
- Finalized web application from an existing prototype
- Collaborated with developers and musicians
- Utilized JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git, the music framework Tone.js, and Gulp
