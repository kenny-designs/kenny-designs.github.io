# Who Is This Guy?

*Hey I'm Alexander :3*

## Introductions
I am a programmer and a bit of an artist as well (the header image I made myself in Blender!)
I started programming in my early teens because I had a huge interest in making
games. I didn't really have anyone to show me the ropes so I took it upon myself
to grab whatever books I could to learn to program.

From there, I spent a lot of time playing with code and pursuing 3D art. I would go on to
make my own little game engine with DirectX and found the programming to be so much fun
that I wanted to turn it into a career!

As of now, I'm finishing up my BS in Computer Science at Brooklyn College and am excited
to begin working as a programmer!

## Programming
First and foremost, I am a programmer! Ever since I was a young teen, I've been
messing with code. In the many years since, I've worked with tons of languages
to create all sorts of projects.

### Programming Languages
- C++
- JavaScript
- Java
- C#
- Python
- GLSL

I'm also experienced in SQL, HTML, and CSS albeit I wouldn't quite say those are programming
languages!

## Technologies & Software
In addition to programming itself, I'm also experienced in various frameworks, libraries,
software, etc.

### Game Engines
- Unreal Engine 4
- Unity
- Phaser
- PyGame
- RenPy

### Graphics/GUI Related
- OpenGL
- DirectX
- Qt
- GLFW
- Three.js

### Web Related
- Node.js
- Express
- MySQL
- Java Servlets and JSP (Java Server Pages)
- Bootstrap
- React
- npm
- Jekyll (which this site was made from!)
- Tone.js

### Software
- Linux (❤️ Debian)
- Vim
- Git
- Blender
- Photoshop
- Krita
- Gimp

## College
I'm currently a senior attending Brooklyn College in NYC. I am studying Computer
Science with an expected graduation date of June 2021.

I have a **3.9/4.0 GPA**.

I am a member of the **Honor Society for the Computing and Information Disciplines**.

I've taken the following classes related to programming:

### Classes Finished
- Programming Paradigms in C++
- Modern Programming Techniques (Java)
- Data Structures
- Design and Implementation of Large-Scale Web Applications
- Operating Systems
- Computer Architecture
- Theoretical Computer Science
- Robotics
- Linear Algebra
- Multivariable Calculus

### Classes In Progress
- Algorithms
- Computer Graphics Programming

## Experience

I interned as a programmer with the **NYU Music Experience Design Lab** from June
to September in 2017.

### Front-End Developer
- Overhauled the lab’s prototype web game Lyric Blaster into a polished experience over 2 months.
- Collaborated with the lead engineer of the lab and musicians to improve gameplay and UI.
- Coded the project with JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the GUI and Tone.js to manage music.
- Co-ordinated with team members via Slack and GitHub to review code and gather feedback.
