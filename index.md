      Hey there! I'm a programmer from NYC that is in their senior year
      studying Computer Science at Brooklyn College. During this time and even
      some years before, I've been teaching myself to program, make games, websites,
      and even create some 3D art. I love what I do and I want to share what I've
      been up to with <b>you!</b> Yes you. As such, I invite you to take a stroll around
      my website and see if there's anything you like.
